# U.S. Census Economic Trends Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between median house prices and various demographic variables across U.S. counties from 2011 to 2019. Through a series of visualizations and statistical analyses, the project aims to answer key questions about how house prices have changed over time and what factors influence these changes.

## Key Questions

1. **How have median house prices and our variables changed over time?**
2. **How do our selected demographic variables correlate with median house prices across counties in the USA?**
3. **Are median house prices higher in counties with a more educated population?**
4. **What is the distribution of housing prices in high-poverty vs. low-poverty areas?**
5. **How do median house prices and poverty rates compare across urban and rural areas in the USA?**

![output4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d41927-0bd3-4ac3-bf38-3bf18145044d)

- **Education and House Prices:** Positive correlation between the percentage of population with a bachelor's degree and median house prices.
- **Median Income and House Prices:** Strong positive relationship between median household income and house prices.
- **Employment Rates and House Prices:** Weak positive correlation between employment rates and house prices.
- **Poverty Rates and House Prices:** Moderate inverse relationship between poverty rates and house prices.

### Are median house prices higher in counties with a more educated population?

- Analysis shows a significant difference in house prices between counties with higher education levels and those with lower education levels. T-test results confirm that higher educational attainment is associated with higher median house prices.

### What is the distribution of housing prices in high-poverty vs. low-poverty areas?

- **Box Plots Comparison:** Highlight the disparities in housing prices between low-poverty and high-poverty areas. Low-poverty areas have higher and more variable house prices, while high-poverty areas have lower and more consistent house prices.

### How do median house prices and poverty rates compare across urban and rural areas in the USA?
![output10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adae340d-280c-4e37-be11-5a7dc8b2a683)
![output9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8e11ac-4381-4ce0-89bc-ee83d647821d)

- **Urban vs. Rural Analysis:** Urban areas exhibit higher median house prices and lower poverty rates, while rural areas have lower house prices and higher poverty rates. This reflects the economic and housing market disparities between urban and rural regions.

## Visualizations

- **Histograms:** Median house prices for 2011, 2015, and 2019.
- **Line Graphs:** Growth trends of house prices, education levels, household income, employment, and poverty rates.
- **Scatter Plots:** Relationships between education, income, employment rates, poverty rates, and house prices.
- **Box Plots:** Distribution of housing prices in low-poverty vs. high-poverty areas.
- **Urban vs. Rural Comparison:** Median house prices and poverty rates.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the interplay between demographic variables and median house prices, reflecting broader economic and social trends. The findings can inform policy decisions and real estate investment strategies.
